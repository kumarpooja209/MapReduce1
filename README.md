# MapReduce1
The historical interstate traffic data is analysed, to predict weather condition and traffic volume. This study also investigates how different climatic condition affects traffic volume. Hadoop framework is used to manage the large dataset by storing it in distributed file system. As MapReduce is not suitable for forecasting, simple moving average statistical model is used for prediction along with MapReduce program. To predict time series rolling window method is applied, where the consecutive information of particular window size is observed to predict the future.

(In this code based on the window size the values will be predicted little modeification is required in that part)
